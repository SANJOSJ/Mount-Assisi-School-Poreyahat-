                    The school is named after the immortal St. Francis of Assisi. According to a survey, he is the greatest man born during the second millennium. Men and women, regardless of creed or nationality, have acclaimed him as the World’s most influential social religious reformer.</p>
        <p> St. Francis was born in Assisi, Italy, in 1182 as the son of Peter Bernardone and Picca. He received his primary education at the local St. George’s Church. At the age of fourteen he joined his father’s business as a merchant. At seventeen he was drawn into a civil war in the city. When he was twenty years old, Assisi was defeated in a war with Perugia and Francis was imprisoned. When released, Francis returned home in broken health. At the age of twenty three, he set off again to join the army. But on the way he fell ill. During his recovery he had a mysterious dream which changed his life completely.</p>
        <p>Upon his return to Assisi, Francis was no more interested in fame, power or wealth. Moved by God's grace, he opted for a life of poverty. He spent his time in prayer, austerity and service to others. Jesus Christ and his Gospel influenced Francis deeply. He formulated Rules for men and women who desired to follow him. He went about for several years proclaiming the message of peace, joy and love to all. St. Francis died in 1226. His followers who are known as "Franciscans" constitute the largest group within the Catholic Church.</p>
        <p>Throughout the centuries, millions of admirers all over the world have been attracted by the life and ideals of St. Francis. His charm is perennial and his personality universal. Mahatma Gandhi used to recite every day the Peace Prayer of St. Francis.</p>
        <p>St. Francis saw God's goodness in every creature. His "Canticle of the Sun" is considered the most beautiful poem in Italian. He is honoured as the universal Patron of Ecology and of the Society of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Love was the theme of St. Francis' life and peace his message. Assisi has become a synonym of peace. The World Conference of peace which was attended by leaders from every religion was held in Assisi in 1987.</p>
        <p>The first Franciscans arrived in India in 1292. Since then the sons and daughters of St. Francis have contributed immensely to the development of our country. Our school is truly proud to have such an illustrious patron. May St. Francis help us to live the values he cherished most: simplicity, peace, love and universal brotherhood.</p>
